A bit of an update as I don't want to go back and edit the original README - if at any point any of you have questions about the project that -DO NOT- pertain to the subjects discussed or the posts that I make; i.e. directly relating to the subject matter outside of project discussion, you can reach me at my email at [readmeexperiment@gmail.com] Feel free to ask whatever you like and if it falls within the scope of what I deem to be an appropriate question I will absolutely answer it; or if you want to hear more on something, you can also ask me to elaborate a little bit more and I will do my best to make another commit regarding the requested subject matter within 48-72 horus.
